## Replacement briefs

### Hero

Premium realistic commercial photography of a contemporary African/Nigerian rider naturally entering a clean modern sedan in a credible urban Nigerian environment. Keep the subject and vehicle on the right to preserve the approved overlay composition and negative space on the left. Use natural daylight, realistic hands, hair, clothing, windows, wheels, reflections, and vehicle geometry. Avoid generated text, fake branding, warped vehicles, luxury-chauffeur styling, and anatomy defects. Target a genuine 2400-3200px long-edge master with a matching mobile crop.

### Rider

Premium realistic everyday urban mobility photography showing a contemporary African/Nigerian rider in or beside a clean modern vehicle. Preserve the approved rider-led crop and room for the status overlay. Use natural expressions, hands, vehicle interior, and city context. Target a genuine 1800-2600px long-edge master.

### Driver

Premium realistic driver-acquisition photography showing a confident contemporary African/Nigerian driver seated in a clean modern vehicle. Preserve room for the opportunity UI overlay. Show credible hands, steering wheel, dashboard, mirrors, windows, and vehicle geometry. Target a genuine 1800-2600px long-edge master.

### Courier

Premium realistic urban courier photography showing a professional African/Nigerian courier handling a parcel beside a credible bicycle or delivery vehicle. Preserve room for the tracking/status overlay. Ensure hands, package, straps, bicycle geometry, clothing, and street context are coherent. Target a genuine 1800-2600px long-edge master.

These assets are visually usable for the current implementation but remain placeholder-named and below the preferred master-source targets. They should receive human creative approval and replacement before public launch; no arbitrary external or copyrighted images were downloaded.
